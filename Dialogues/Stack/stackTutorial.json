    {"name":"Guru","text":"Hey there, adventurer! I've got a stack of knowledge to share with you today. Ready to dive into the world of stacks?"},
    {"name":"Guru","text":"Haha, your GURU reporting for duty! Alright, imagine a stack like a big pile of pancakes."},
    {"name":"Guru","text":"You can only add or remove a pancake from the top. We call it a LAST IN, FIRST OUT structure. Hungry yet?"},
    {"name":"Guru","text":"TOP pointer points to where the topmost pancake is, so always keep track of it."},
    {"name":"Guru","text":"Let's say we've got a stack with pancakes labeled 1, 2, and 3. If we add pancake 4, it's gonna be the new star at the top."},
    {"name":"Guru","text":"We call adding a pancake PUSHing. So, go ahead and PUSH a pancake onto the stack using the button."},
    {"name":"Guru","text":"This is the algorithm for PUSH...."},
    {"name":"Guru","text":"We first check for OVERFLOW. Overflow signifies that the stack cannot accommodate any additional elements, similar to pouring water into a glass already filled to the brim."},
    {"name":"Guru","text":"Then we increment top and add the value to the stack."},
    {"name":"Guru","text":"Since it's LAST IN-FIRST OUT, you'll devour pancake number 4 before getting to the others. The one at TOP first!"},
